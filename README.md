# wolfSSL / wolfCrypt Asynchronous Support

This repository contains the async.c and async.h files required for using Asynchronous Cryptography with the wolfSSL library.

* The async.c file goes into `./wolfcrypt/src/`.
* The async.h file goes into `./wolfssl/wolfcrypt/`.

This feature is enabled using:
`./configure --enable-asynccrypt` or `#define WOLFSSL_ASYNC_CRYPT`.

If async crypto is enabled but no hardware backend is enabled or if `WOLFSSL_ASYNC_CRYPT_SW` is defined, a software backend using wolfCrypt is used instead. This software backend can simulate periodic hardware delays using the macro `WOLF_ASYNC_SW_SKIP_MOD`, which is on by default if `DEBUG_WOLFSSL` is defined.

## Design

Each crypto algorithm has its own `WC_ASYNC_DEV` structure, which contains a `WOLF_EVENT`, local crypto context and local hardware context.

For SSL/TLS the `WOLF_EVENT` context is the `WOLFSSL*` and the type is `WOLF_EVENT_TYPE_ASYNC_WOLFSSL`. For wolfCrypt operations the `WOLF_EVENT` context is the `WC_ASYNC_DEV*` and the type is `WOLF_EVENT_TYPE_ASYNC_WOLFCRYPT`.

A generic event system has been created using a `WOLF_EVENT` structure when `HAVE_WOLF_EVENT` is defined. The event structure resides in the `WC_ASYNC_DEV`.

The asynchronous crypto system is modeled after epoll. The implementation uses `wolfSSL_AsyncPoll` or `wolfSSL_CTX_AsyncPoll` to check if any async operations are complete.

## Hardware Backends

Supported hardware backends:

* Intel QuickAssist with QAT 1.6 or QAT 1.7 driver. See README.md in `wolfcrypt/src/port/intel/README.md`.
* Cavium Nitrox III and V. See README.md in `wolfcrypt/src/port/cavium/README.md`.

## wolfCrypt Backend

The wolfCrypt backend uses the same API as the hardware backends do. Once an asynchronous operation is initiated with the software backend, subsequent calls to `wolfSSL_AsyncPoll` will call into wolfCrypt to complete the operation. If non-blocking is enabled, for example, for ECC (via `WC_ECC_NONBLOCK`), each `wolfSSL_AsyncPoll` will do a chunk of work for the operation and return, to minimize blocking time.

## API's

### ```wolfSSL_AsyncPoll```
```
int wolfSSL_AsyncPoll(WOLFSSL* ssl, WOLF_EVENT_FLAG flags);
```

Polls the provided WOLFSSL object's reference to the WOLFSSL_CTX's event queue to see if any operations outstanding for the WOLFSSL object are done. Return the completed event count on success.

### ```wolfSSL_CTX_AsyncPoll```
```
int wolfSSL_CTX_AsyncPoll(WOLFSSL_CTX* ctx, WOLF_EVENT** events, int maxEvents, WOLF_EVENT_FLAG flags, int* eventCount)
```

Polls the provided WOLFSSL_CTX context event queue to see if any pending events are done. If the `events` argument is provided then a pointer to the `WOLF_EVENT` will be returned up to `maxEvents`. If `eventCount` is provided then the number of events populated will be returned. The `flags` allows for `WOLF_POLL_FLAG_CHECK_HW` to indicate if the crypto backend (i.e. hardware or wolfCrypt, if the software implementation is being used) should be polled again or just return more events.

### ```wolfAsync_DevOpen```
```
int wolfAsync_DevOpen(int *devId);
```

Open the async device and returns an `int` device id for it.

### ```wolfAsync_DevOpenThread```
```
int wolfAsync_DevOpenThread(int *devId, void* threadId);
```
Opens the async device for a specific thread. A crypto instance is assigned and thread affinity set.

### ```wolfAsync_DevClose```
```
void wolfAsync_DevClose(int *devId)
```

Closes the async device.

### ```wolfAsync_DevCopy```
```
int wolfAsync_DevCopy(WC_ASYNC_DEV* src, WC_ASYNC_DEV* dst);
```

Copy async device memory safe (not pointers to old device).

### ```wolfAsync_DevCtxInit```
```
int wolfAsync_DevCtxInit(WC_ASYNC_DEV* asyncDev, word32 marker, void* heap, int devId);
```

Initialize the device context and open the device hardware using the provided `WC_ASYNC_DEV ` pointer, marker and device id (from wolfAsync_DevOpen).

### ```wolfAsync_DevCtxFree```
```
void wolfAsync_DevCtxFree(WC_ASYNC_DEV* asyncDev);
```

Closes and free's the device context.


### ```wolfAsync_EventInit```
```
int wolfAsync_EventInit(WOLF_EVENT* event, enum WOLF_EVENT_TYPE type, void* context, word32 flags);
```

Initialize an event structure with provided type and context. Sets the pending flag and the status code to `WC_PENDING_E`. Current flag options are `WC_ASYNC_FLAG_NONE` and `WC_ASYNC_FLAG_CALL_AGAIN` (indicates crypto needs called again after WC_PENDING_E).

### ```wolfAsync_EventWait ```
```
int wolfAsync_EventWait(WOLF_EVENT* event);
```

Waits for the provided event to complete.

### ```wolfAsync_EventPoll```
```
int wolfAsync_EventPoll(WOLF_EVENT* event, WOLF_EVENT_FLAG event_flags);
```

Polls the provided event to determine if its done.

### ```wolfAsync_EventPop ```

```
int wolfAsync_EventPop(WOLF_EVENT* event, enum WOLF_EVENT_TYPE event_type);
```

This will check the event to see if the event type matches and the event is complete. If it is then the async return code is returned. If not then `WC_NOT_PENDING_E` is returned.


### ```wolfAsync_EventQueuePush```
```
int wolfAsync_EventQueuePush(WOLF_EVENT_QUEUE* queue, WOLF_EVENT* event);
```

Pushes an event to the provided event queue and assigns the provided event.

### ```wolfAsync_EventQueuePoll```
```
int wolfAsync_EventQueuePoll(WOLF_EVENT_QUEUE* queue, void* context_filter,
    WOLF_EVENT** events, int maxEvents, WOLF_EVENT_FLAG event_flags, int* eventCount);
```

Polls all events in the provided event queue. Optionally filters by context. Will return pointers to the done events.

### ```wc_AsyncHandle```
```
int wc_AsyncHandle(WC_ASYNC_DEV* asyncDev, WOLF_EVENT_QUEUE* queue, word32 flags);
```

This will push the event inside asyncDev into the provided queue.

### ```wc_AsyncWait```
```
int wc_AsyncWait(int ret, WC_ASYNC_DEV* asyncDev, word32 flags);
```

This will wait until the provided asyncDev is done (or error).

### ```wolfAsync_HardwareStart```
```
int wolfAsync_HardwareStart(void);
```

If using multiple threads this allows a way to start the hardware before using `wolfAsync_DevOpen` to ensure the memory system is setup. Ensure that `wolfAsync_HardwareStop` is called on exit. Internally there is a start/stop counter, so this can be called multiple times, but stop must also be called the same number of times to shutdown the hardware.

### ```wolfAsync_HardwareStop```
```
void wolfAsync_HardwareStop(void);
```

Stops hardware if internal `--start_count == 0`.

## Examples

### TLS Server Example

```c
int devId = INVALID_DEVID;

ret = wolfAsync_DevOpen(&devId);
if (ret != 0) {
    err_sys("Async device open failed");
}
wolfSSL_CTX_SetDevId(ctx, devId);

do {
    err = 0; /* reset error */
    ret = wolfSSL_accept(ssl, msg, msgSz, &msgSz);
    if (ret <= 0) {
        err = wolfSSL_get_error(ssl, 0);
        if (err == WC_PENDING_E) {
            ret = wolfSSL_AsyncPoll(ssl, WOLF_POLL_FLAG_CHECK_HW);
            if (ret < 0) break;
        }
    }
} while (err == WC_PENDING_E);
if (ret != WOLFSSL_SUCCESS) {
    err_sys("SSL_connect failed");
}

wolfAsync_DevClose(&devId);
```

### wolfCrypt RSA Example

```c
static int devId = INVALID_DEVID;
RsaKey key;

ret = wolfAsync_DevOpen(&devId);
if (ret != 0)
    err_sys("Async device open failed");

wc_InitRsaKey_ex(&key, HEAP_HINT, devId);
if (ret == 0) {
    ret = wc_RsaPrivateKeyDecode(tmp, &idx, &key, (word32)bytes);
    do {
        ret = wc_AsyncWait(ret, &key.asyncDev, WC_ASYNC_FLAG_CALL_AGAIN);
        if (ret >= 0)
            ret = wc_RsaPublicEncrypt(in, inLen, out, outSz, &key, &rng);
    } while (ret == WC_PENDING_E);
    wc_FreeRsaKey(&key);
}

wolfAsync_DevClose(&devId);
```

## Build Options

1. Async multi-threading can be disabled by defining `WC_NO_ASYNC_THREADING`. This only disables internal async threading functions. You are free to use other threading APIs or paradigms in your application.
2. Software benchmarks can be disabled by defining `NO_SW_BENCH`.
3. The `WC_ASYNC_THRESH_NONE` define can be used to disable the cipher thresholds, which are tunable values to determine at what size hardware should be used vs. software.
4. Use `WOLFSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY` and `WOLFSSL_TRACK_MEMORY` to help debug memory issues. QAT also supports `WOLFSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY_PRINT`.
